# Is the Original VGG Network Overfitting?

![Generalizability for VGG Configurations](images/vgg%20generalizability.png)

Full Report [here](Experimental%20Analysis%20of%20VGG%20NNs.pdf):

- We found potential overfitting in VGG networks on MNIST, despite identical Memory-Equivalent Capacity (MEC).
- Reducing model size to 1/128th of the original maintained perfect accuracy, with varying noise sensitivity across configurations.
